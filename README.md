AND101 Project 1 - Hello, Squirrel!

Submitted by: Antonio Logan

Time spent: 1 hour spent in total

Summary

Hello, Squirrel! is an Android app that recreates a fun introduction screen similar to “Hello, World!”, but personalized for a neighborhood squirrel 🐿. The app displays a custom profile card showing my name, personal bio, and top three hobbies. It was a simple but helpful project to get comfortable with Android layout editing and resource management.

If I had to describe this project in three (3) emojis, they would be: 🐿️📱✨

Notes

This project helped reinforce how Android uses resource files (strings.xml, layout XMLs) and how small changes can update the UI quickly. I learned how to customize a simple app and gained confidence navigating Android Studio’s layout editor and preview system.
